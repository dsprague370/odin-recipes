<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>1 pound sweet Italian sausage

    ¾ pound lean ground beef
    
    ½ cup minced onion
    
    2 cloves garlic, crushed
    
    1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
    
    2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce
    
    2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
    
    ½ cup water
    
    2 tablespoons white sugar
    
    4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided
    
    1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves
    
    1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste
    
    1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
    
    ½ teaspoon fennel seeds
    
    ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
    
    12 lasagna noodles
    
    16 ounces ricotta cheese
    
    1 egg
    
    ¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced
    
    ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        1- Gather all your ingredients.
        2- Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned
        3- Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.


        4- Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
        5- In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
        6- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        7- To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
        8- Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
        9- Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
        10- Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
